# Employee-Tracker

## Description

My motivation to build this employee tracker was to make sure my organization stays up to date in every area, especially our valued employees. 
So in other words, i built this app to maximize employee experience and minimize company expense. The problem this solves is now we are able to keep track of who works where, makes what, and as well as regular PTO reporting and HR assistance with salary expenses. I learned how to utilize the database to update things on the backend!
